# Communicate Data Findings Project

## Summary

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, I will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process. __Exploratory data visualization__ generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method used to understand the patterns and relationships present in  data. This understanding will help approaches any statistical analyses and will help build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed. __Explanatory data visualization__ techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate results to stakeholders. Understanding design considerations will make sure that the message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help to be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.

This work focused on the analysis of the Prosper Loan Data. The analysis covered univariate, bivariate and multivariate data analysis. Many plots and statistics were made to help the visualization and insight gain of the data.

## Tools

To achieve the goals of this project the following libraries from Python were used:
• numpy
• matplotlib
• pandas
• seaborn

## Dataset

This [Prosper Loan Dataset](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv&sa=D&ust=1547699802003000)
contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, 
borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
The [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit?usp=sharing) explains the 
variables in the data set.
The project objective is not expected to explore all of the variables in the dataset. A subset of were chosen to be analyzed.
