## Summary

The goal of this project is to analyze local and global temperature data and compare temperature trends. I chose Brazil as the country to be compared with the overall.

## Instructions

* **Extract the data** from the database. The needed data is extracted as the files **rio_data.csv** and **rio_join_data.csv**.
* **Open up the CSV** in order to make analysis.
* **Create a line chart.** that compares city's temperatures with the global temperatures. I made sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
* **Make observations.** All insights extracted from the data are in the pdf file named "Explore Weather Trends".

## Tools

In order to complete this project **Microsoft Excel** and **SQL** were used to analyze and extract the needed data.
