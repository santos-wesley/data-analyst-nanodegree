# No Show Appointment Patients Project

## Summary

The goal of this project is to analyze  a dataset and then communicate findings about it. I chose the No-Show Medical Appointment dataset curated by Kaggle. The dataset was provided by Udacity and it is the ***nspa.csv*** file.
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

* ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
* ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
* ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
* The last column says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

The research questions (RQ) emerged through the dataset is as follows:
1)The age: does it have any kind of impact or relationship in terms of people showing up for medical appointments or not?
2)Age & Scholarship: The combination of both had impact or relationship in terms of people showing up for appointments or not?
