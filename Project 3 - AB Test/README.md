# Analyze A/B Test Results Project

## Summary

For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to work through a notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The data and the Jupyter Notebook, which are all of the files needed to complete the project, are provided in this repository. Note that portions of the notebook reference back to quizzes made by Udacity and are answered.

## Instructions

* **Download the dataset**.
* **Get organized** in order to make analysis: one only folder with the Jupyter notebook and ab_data csv file.
* **Analyze the data.** An analysis of the A/B test was made in order to answer the quizzes inside the notebook.
* **Share the findings.** All insights extracted from the data are inside the Jupyter notebook..

## Tools

In order to complete this project **pandas**, **numPy**, **random**, **Matplotlib** and **csv** libraries were used.
