# Wrangle and Analyze Data Project

![WeRateDogs Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santos-wesley/udacity-data-analyst-nanodegree/main/Project%204%20-%20Data%20Wrangling/images/dog-rates-social.jpg)

## Summary

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. I documented the wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook (**wrangle_report**), plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and SQL (**wrangle_act and act_report**).

The dataset that will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.
